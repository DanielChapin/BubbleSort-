# BubbleSort++

A simple visualizer of the bubble sort algorithm written in C++ using SFML.

## Controls

[SPACE] to take a single sorting step.

[P] to toggle autosort.

[ESCAPE] to exit the program.

## Setup

Run `make setup` (or make equivalent).

OR

Run `mkdir bin`.

THEN

Set `SFMLPath` in `Makefile` to your SFML build.

Run `make` to compile. 

**NOTE** This project uses the static SFML libs.

The application is stored in the `bin` directory.
